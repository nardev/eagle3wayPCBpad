I believe somebody else also made something similar. It's sometimes simply a need. I tried to make it like peace sign but i couldn't make it in eagle as easy as this. I hope someone will find it useful.

I found it useful on a board where i want to have an option to:
1. have input button which i connect to another side of a PCB (just passing a line)
2. Redirect the input button to a MCU
3. Use output terminal as input and redirect the signal to a MCU

.. I don't know if you could understand but.. i believe just by looking at it, it's clear what it can be used for.
